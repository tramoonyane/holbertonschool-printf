.Sh NAME
.Nm _printf
.Nd Holberton School formatted output conversion
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm #include "main.h"
.Pp
.Nm _printf(const char *
.Ar format
, ...);
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
function is an emulator of the C <stdio.h> library printf() function.
.Pp
The
.Nm
function writes values to
.Ar stdout
according to a
.Ar format
string that defines how arguments wil be converted for output. These arguments
will be described further down in this manual.
.Pp
.Sh Format of the format string
.Pp
The
.Ar format
string is a character string enclosed in double quotes. This format string
is composed of characters and conversion specifiers. Conversion specifiers are
preceded by the '%' character. The conversion specifire defines how arguents
will be converted for output. Any conversion specifiers may be preceded by
characters, separated by characters(if there is more than one conversion
specifier), or followed by characters. Any characters will also be printed
to the standard output.
.Pp
The arguments that are passed into the function must correspond with the
conversion specifiers. Each argument will be separated by a comma. If these
arguments and conversion specifiers do not correspond,
.Nm
will misbehave.
.Pp
.Sh Conversion specifiers
.Pp
A conversion specifier is a character that is preceded by a '%' character and
are defined below:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width -indent
.It d, i
A signed integer value is printed
.It s
A string (character array) is printed, up to but not including the terminating
null ('\\0') byte.
.It c
A single character is printed.
.El
.Pp
.Sh RETURN VALUE
When the
.Nm
function successfuly executes, the function returns the number
of characters printed.
If an output error is encountered, a negative value is returned.
.Sh NOTES
We've done our best not to plagiarize the PRINTF(3) Linux Programmer's Manual.
There are inherently similar streams of thought and use of vocabulary and
structure that come with creating a function emulator. All credit goes to the
Linux Programmer's Manual.
